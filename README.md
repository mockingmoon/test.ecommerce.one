# test.ecommerce.one
A dynamic front-end E-Commerce web project made using Bootstrap 4, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6. It uses JavaScipt "sessionStorage" for giving the temporary feel of a session. For more info, please check out the README file.

Please use these steps to explore them:
1. First open index.html.
2. Choose either category 1 (i.e. first card) or category 2 (i.e. second card) [prefer 2].
3. If you followed step 2, you should be able to see total 3 shops listed. The top one is a default template. Click on the odd numbered shops (e.g. Shop three or Shop one). This should redirect to products - page for that shop. [prefer shop 3]
4. Again in the products page, there should be one or more products. The top one is a default template. You can add or remove items from cart using the plus or minus buttons respectively. It will show you the total amount. You can proceed to checkout once selected.
5. You have reached the shopping cart page. Here you can see that it has already calculated the total cost of items and total cost of delivery. It has also added them to give you the grand total.
6. Thank you for checking out my website. I really enjoyed making it.
